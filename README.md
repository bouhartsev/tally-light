Tally Lights is an online service for interaction between the broadcast director and cameramen. With Tally Lights Online, you can inform a camera operator that his camera is on air, without any additional equipment.

## How does it work?

The director goes on air. Cameramen connect using their links from any device (phone, tablet). The director can click on the number of the camera that he put on the air - this change will be displayed to others on the set.

At any time, the director can go to the settings page and change the preferences.

### Director page

Green means the camera in preview mode, red means the camera on the air. The camera can be put on the air only after the preview. But double-clicking on the button immediately turns the camera into "on air" mode.

If the camera is not connected, the button with its number has an orange border.
